Clicks
======

A sample Rails application that implements tracking of user clicks using Javascript and a simple API.

Install
-------
It's a Rails app ... just add in a database.yml for your local
environment.

Todo
----
Should really include a bunch of test cases. These should turn up in a
later instalment. This version was about trying out an idea.
